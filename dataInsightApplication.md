* Python - Used every day for data analysis and scripting for more than 5 years. I use packages such as Matplotlib, NumPy and SciPy to do data analysis and visualization for all my PhD research projects, and I also use Scikit-Learn to do machine learning side projects.  

* C - Used everyday to program the simulation code for the research projects for more than 5 years. Usually used together with OpenMP, CUDA-C, and MPI to deliver best parallel performance.

* C++ - Used in part of the research program to integrate with collaborator's code, for about a year.

* SQL, JAVA - Used in online open courses (coursera and udacity courses passed), for a couple of weeks.
